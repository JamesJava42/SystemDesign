Object -- toString,equals,hashcode

If we work on a custom class which have 2 + attributes and we use that in map and perform the fre operation the we need to override the hascode() and equals() methods in the custom class.

class man{
    int age ;
    int code;

    @override
    public Object equals(Object a ){
        a.age==this.age;
        a.code=this.code;

    }
    @overide 
    public int hashcode(){
        return this.age+this.code;
    }

}

HashMap<Man,Ineger> out = new HashMap<>(); //this wont get the freq as per result.
