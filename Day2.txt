OOPS1:
Classes and Objects (Encapsulation)

Activites of a real-entity are functions and Entities of a real-world are data members.
Person p = new Person()
Person p1 = p; -- Reference not an Instance, Both are refer to the same instance;
Instance( new() - keyword),Reference( p )


Static variables are instalised and stored in main class instance when we create a instance of a class and the local variable get initilized but the static vaiable is 
refered from the main class object.

static function -- not use "this"-keyword non-static function use the "this"-keyword
